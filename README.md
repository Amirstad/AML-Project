In this project I've chosen this article [Cyclical learning rates for training neural networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01186.pdf).

The article describes a new method for dynamically changing a CNNâ€™s learning rate to improve its training.

There are a few options to run the code, either run it on an online service such as Google Colab / DataLore / Jupyter, or you can download it and run it in python.

Both options will take a long time to finish unless you have a serious GPU, so better take my word here.
